# Virus_Image_Classification

## Goal
The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has Viral Pneumonia, COVID-19, or is normal through Chest X-Ray Images.

## Setup the Data in Google Colab
-  The Images Dataset can be found on Kaggle at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset 
-  After downloading the dataset, upload the dataset to Google Drive

## Tools/Libraries Used
-  Python General Libraries (pathlib, os, zipfile, random, PIL)
- PyTorch (torch, torchvision)

## Instructions
1. Run the Virus_Image_Classification.ipynb file for Deep Dive into the Deep Learning Aspects of this Project
2. The Notebook will have Sections to Follow Along
